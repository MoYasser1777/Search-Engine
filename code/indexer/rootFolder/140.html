										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>&#8220;MiFi&#8221; (derived from the word &#8220;WiFi&#8221; for Wlan) is another name for mobile Wlan routers. MiFi routers are small devices that connect to the mobile network over 2G, 3G or 4G and create a Wlan network. Such MiFi routers are very handy, as they allow you to access the Internet quickly and easily almost anywhere. So all you need for mobile internet on the road is a SIM card and a MiFi router (mobile wifi router).</p>



<h2><strong>How does a MiFi router work?</strong></h2>



<p>As already mentioned in other blog posts, a mobile wifi router is actually nothing else than a mobile phone without telephone function. A valid SIM from a mobile phone provider must be inserted into the device. After switching on, the MiFi router connects to the nearest mobile phone tower. As soon as the Internet connection is established, you can use any device with Wlan to access the Internet: It&#8217;s like having a small Internet modem in your pocket. Thanks to their integrated battery and low weight, these routers can actually be taken anywhere and are the perfect companion for everyday life.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<iframe title="Smartphone vs MiFi - Which is Better to Hotspot From?" width="825" height="464" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ak7LGtt7eWY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div></figure>



<h2>Before you buy: The different routers</h2>



<p>You should be aware that there are different MiFi routers for different deployment scenarios. We present the different device properties.</p>



<p><strong>LTE routers:</strong> MiFi routers with LTE are definitely the fastest devices. LTE 4G is the latest connection standard for mobile Internet. More than 100 Mbit/s are possible. These practical companions are faster than ordinary copper cable Internet on land.</p>



<p><strong>3G router:</strong> 3G routers without LTE are somewhat slower, but still manage 20 &#8211; 30 Mbps under good conditions. Such routers are cheaper and are recommended especially if it is certain that no LTE transmission mast is planned in the near future in the vicinity.</p>



<p>I<strong>nternet Stick:</strong> Unlike Wlan routers, these sticks do not create a Wlan network. They are connected to a laptop or computer via USB. This then has a connection to the Internet. Practical if you only need the Internet on one device. </p>



<h2>What is a Wlan Router with SIM card?</h2>



<p>As already briefly mentioned in the introduction, this type of router is a mobile Wlan router. Normal DSL routers connect to the Internet provider&#8217;s server via telephone lines. Wlan routers with SIM card connect to the Internet via the mobile phone network.</p>



<p><strong>The advantages are obvious:</strong></p>



<ul><li>Mobility &#8211; device can be placed anywhere, no need to worry about special sockets</li><li> Speed &#8211; thanks to 3G and 4G you can surf at up to 100 Mbps</li><li> Reliability &#8211; with old telephone lines something can quickly go wrong, there is (almost) always a mobile network</li><li> Portability &#8211; some mobile Wlan routers come with built-in battery, perfect for travel</li></ul>



<p><strong>Downside:</strong></p>



<ul><li>no real flatrate &#8211; as soon as the data volume is used up, the speed is reduced</li></ul>



<h2><strong>What if there is only bad mobile phone reception in my town?</strong></h2>



<p>Mobile Wlan routers usually have a stronger antenna than normal smartphones. Try to connect to a Wlan router with SIM card. If there are still problems, you can return the router or buy an amplifier antenna.</p>



<h2><strong>Is a WLAN router with SIM card faster than conventional DSL Internet?</strong></h2>



<p>Yes and no. In urban areas the speed will probably be in the same range, as DSL lines are well developed there. Wifi routers with a SIM card are especially useful in rural areas or when you are on the move.</p>



<h2><strong>Do Wifi routers with integrated battery exist?</strong></h2>



<p>Yes, most mobile wifi routers offer an integrated battery.</p>



<h2><strong>How does the configuration of such a Wlan router work?</strong></h2>



<p>Wlan routers with a contract are usually pre-configured by the manufacturer. You only have to switch it on &#8211; the device connects to the mobile network by itself and the Wlan network is active after a few seconds.</p>



<h2><strong>Where can I use the router to go?</strong></h2>



<p><strong><br></strong>As mentioned above, such a router needs power and a cellular network to work.</p>



<p>Mobile Internet speeds compared in Europe today, there is a sufficiently fast network almost everywhere. While Edge allows you to surf at a snail&#8217;s pace, 3G or 4G is fast enough to download large files or stream a movie, for example.</p>



<p>Although the antennas of mobile wifi routers are generously sized, it is rather unlikely that you will be able to connect to the Internet in dead spots.</p>



<p>On the websites of the individual providers you can find out where which network is available &#8211; for example at the Telekom.</p>



<p>As far as electricity is concerned, most devices have an integrated battery. However, the runtimes vary considerably from router to router. For example, some routers only last 4-5 hours, while other devices allow up to 12 hours of surfing pleasure.</p>



<h2>Can I use the mobile router abroad?</h2>



<p>The routers also work without problems abroad. However, it is important to know what tariff you have.</p>



<p>While there are no roaming fees for conventional contracts in Europe since last year, the situation is somewhat different for Internet-only tariffs. Here it depends on the provider whether surfing abroad is allowed.</p>



<h2>Which connections should mobile Wlan routers have?</h2>



<p>Mobile Wlan routers can have different types of connections. The most common types are micro-SD slots for memory cards, USB for USB sticks and micro USB for power.</p>



<p>There are also devices that have a Lan connector or an Ethernet port. Then it is possible to connect devices directly to the router via cable.</p>



<p>It is recommended to choose a device with a Lan connection. Some models even have up to four Lan ports. It is also practical if the mobile router offers the possibility of connecting a printer to it via a USB port.</p>



<p>If you can even connect an external antenna, you can easily increase the signal strength, which in turn can improve the speed and stability of the connection.</p>



<p>This shows that a comparison of different devices is very important to find the right model. However, because a good wlan router is not only about speed, but above all about the type and number of connections, special care should be taken to ensure that the device can be used later as desired.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Interconnection of networks helps to expand your horizon when vast information has to be accessed. Making networks large enough at one end can be a bad choice technically because of many security threats involved. As an alternative to this setting, the interconnection router seems to be the best choice available.</p>
<p>Connect a router to another to expand a network and see the security pouring in and besides that, it is always easy to connect preexisting networks together instead of expanding the existing networks that you have.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-298" src="https://www.192-168-1-1-ip.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/interconnect-routers.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="360" srcset="https://www.192-168-1-1-ip.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/interconnect-routers.jpg 640w, https://www.192-168-1-1-ip.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/interconnect-routers-300x169.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<h2>HOW TO CONNECT THE ROUTERS TOGETHER?</h2>
<p>While going to router interconnection check the steps below to ensure that process is easier and convenient and no technical glitches come up during the setup. Router interconnection is set up by the following considerations:</p>
<p>Identify the set of router you will connect together, have one system to configure the routers, one Ethernet cable, extra power outlets</p>
<p>To set the first router, connect it to the computer through the Ethernet cable, turn on the modem and open the web browser and go to the admin panel and enable the DHCP on router 1. Test this network and disconnect afterward to check if the router is working properly.</p>
<p>For router 2, follow the above procedure and disable DHCP and assign a new IP address to it, set the name of router 2 and pass the key to router 1.</p>
<p>These steps complete the procedure of router setting and after these settings are managed, start with the network. In reality, when you try to get the Netgear Router Login, the modem and the wifi routers should be in the same configuration settings.</p>
<p></p>
<h2>SETTING UP NETWORK AFTER ROUTER INTERCONNECTION</h2>
<p>Network set up is easier and you need to restart router 2 and connect it to router 1 through the Ethernet cable. When the first router is receiving internet connection after setting modem on, router 2 will also receive the signals, which indicate network interconnection through routers.</p>
<p>Now, comes the turn to connect devices with respective routers through wireless or Ethernet cable. The choice is yours but ensure that everything turns out to be quite correct so that least chances of technical faults are there.</p>
<p></p>
<h2>CONSIDERATION TO MAKE ROUTER INTERCONNECTION EASIER</h2>
<p>You have to keep in mind some factors which help to make this interconnection easier and better. Avoid the chances of incorrect settings as in that case computers will not get connected with the routers which may cause other types of delays. After you have set up routers, make sure you note down IP addresses of all the devices such as modem and computers which are connected to the network.</p>
<p>In case, the routers get disconnected, you need to reconfigure it and set the static IP address of the device. You may also use the DHCP switch of the device so that interconnection process is easier.</p>
<p>Owing to the benefits of router interconnection, many firms are adopting this interconnection technique in order to gain better performance and speedy data transfer in a cost-effective method. So, this is how things are made easier through router interconnection which eventually enhances the scope of benefits gained from routers.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Whether you want to check the connection between the router and the computer or check your Internet connection, Windows has a handy utility called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command_Prompt">Command prompt</a>, which enables the user to perform different tasks using various commands. Although this goes beyond the skills of the average user, it is always good to know how to do the first two thing with the help of the so called ping command. The next few paragraphs will explain the ping command and how to do it properly.</p>
<h3><strong>How to ping your router?</strong></h3>
<p>To ping your router first you have to know its default IP address. Finding the router’s IP and the ping command are executed via the Command prompt, so the procedure is as follows.</p>
<p>First you have to open up the Command Prompt. In <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_7">Windows 7</a>, you have to type CMD in the Search box in the Start menu and press Enter on the keyboard.</p>
<p></p>
<p>When the Command Prompt opens, in order to find what is the default IP of your router, you have to type the following command “<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/ipconfig"><b>ipconfig</b></a>“. Look for the part which says Default gateway. This is your router IP address. In most cases it starts with 192.168. For example, if you own a Linksys router this number should be 192.168.1.1.</p>
<p>The next step is to ping the router. While the Command Prompt is still open type the following command:</p>
<p><strong>Ping 192.168.1.1 -t</strong></p>
<p>Some sources suggest pinging the router without the -t switch at the end. Let’s see what is the difference between these two.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><iframe style="width: 40rem; height: 20rem;" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TxNyXa-Gvp8" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<h3><strong>Pinging with or without -t</strong></h3>
<p>If you are in doubt whether to use the -t switch or not, read the following and decide.</p>
<p>When you ping the router’s IP address without the -t switch at the end (<strong><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s16bim_cLOY">ping 192.168.1.1</a></strong>), the ping command will send 4 packets of data to the router and you will receive 4 responses. In most cases this is enough to show whether the problem is between the router and the PC.</p>
<p></p>
<p>On the other hand, when we add the -t switch at the end of the <a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc737478%28v=ws.10%29.aspx">ping command</a> (<strong>ping 192.168.1.1 -t</strong>), the number of packets sent to the router is indefinite, which means the packets will be sent until the user interrupts this command. This command is interrupted in two ways:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Ctrl + C</strong> – this will stop the pinging completely</li>
<li><strong>Ctrl + Break or Ctrl + Pause</strong> – this will stop the pinging for a few seconds, give the summary up to that point and then continue</li>
</ol>
<p>Analyzing the results of the ping command can be somewhat tricky. However, ideally you should receive the same number of sent packets and have 0% of lost packets. This means that everything is OK.</p>
<p>Using the “<strong>ping 192.168.1.1 -t</strong>” alternatively called Continuous or Extended Ping command is there to help you check for potential internet connectivity or router problems. As you can see, you can do this in a few seconds and you may get the idea about what is going on at that moment. Therefore, give it a try. You have nothing to lose!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Have you tried to log in to your router using 192.168.o.1 as a default IP address? Nothing happened and you couldn’t access the router settings? There is nothing to worry about anymore since the following few paragraphs will tell you how to fix this minor issue and properly login to your router.</p>
<p>If you are a proud owner of a D-Link or Netgear wireless router at some point you will have the need to login to your router settings and try to make slight modifications of the default settings. Here you can either make the router more secure or troubleshoot some networking problems.</p>
<h2 class="text-main-header">The 192.168.o.1 Problem and the Solution</h2>
<p>Well, let’s get straight to the point. The reasons why you couldn’t login to your router is because of a small typing mistake. Instead of <strong>192.168.o.1</strong> you should have typed <strong>192.168.0.1</strong>.</p>
<p>To make things more clear why 192.168.o.1 is not the right combination we have to say that we are dealing with an IP address here. By the definition an IP address is a “string of numbers”.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-283" src="https://www.192-168-1-1-ip.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/ip-address.jpg" alt="" width="665" height="300" srcset="https://www.192-168-1-1-ip.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/ip-address.jpg 665w, https://www.192-168-1-1-ip.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/ip-address-300x135.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 665px) 100vw, 665px" /></p>
<p>Therefore the letter “o” has nothing to do here and there is the mistake.</p>
<p></p>
<h2 class="text-main-header">How to properly login to your router</h2>
<p>So, to login to your router there are several steps you have to do before.</p>
<p><strong>– Check if the router and the PC are properly connected</strong></p>
<p><strong>– Check the router default IP address</strong></p>
<p><strong>– Find the default username and password for your router</strong></p>
<h3 class="text-main-header">Step 1</h3>
<p>The first thing to do here is to check the Ethernet cable and whether everything is connected properly. To login to your router you either have to make a physical connection using an Ethernet cable, or you can login to the router from your laptop but make sure that the laptop is part of your home network, otherwise you won’t be able to login to the router.</p>
<h3 class="text-main-header">Step 2</h3>
<p>Once you have checked all the wire connections and both the router and the PC are turned on, you have to check what is the default IP address of your router.</p>
<p>To do this, start the Command prompt (see <a href="http://www.wikihow.com/Open-the-Command-Prompt-in-Windows">here</a> how to do this) and in the new window type the following command:</p>
<p><code>ipconfig</code></p>
<p>Wait a second and scroll down to the part where the <strong>Default Gateway</strong> is mentioned.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-282" src="https://www.192-168-1-1-ip.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Default-Gateway-192.168.0.1.jpg" alt="" width="578" height="58" srcset="https://www.192-168-1-1-ip.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Default-Gateway-192.168.0.1.jpg 578w, https://www.192-168-1-1-ip.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Default-Gateway-192.168.0.1-300x30.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 578px) 100vw, 578px" /></p>
<p>The numbers presented there are the default router IP address. If you own a D-Link or Netgear router you will see either 192.168.0.1 or 192.168.1.1. There is a chance that you will see other numbers after 192.168 but it is not the problem. Whatever you see it is the default IP of your router.</p>
<p></p>
<h3 class="text-main-header">Step 3</h3>
<p>The next step is to type this IP into the browser address bar. Please make sure not to type it to the Search bar. We are sure you won’t type 192.168.o.1 now.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-281" src="https://www.192-168-1-1-ip.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/192.168.0.1-Address-bar.jpg" alt="" width="539" height="172" srcset="https://www.192-168-1-1-ip.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/192.168.0.1-Address-bar.jpg 539w, https://www.192-168-1-1-ip.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/192.168.0.1-Address-bar-300x96.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 539px) 100vw, 539px" /></p>
<h3 class="text-main-header">Step 4</h3>
<p>If you have done everything properly you will be asked to enter the router default username and password. In most cases you will find the router login credentials in the user’s manual or printed on a label which is normally placed under the router. If you don’t have these, either visit the router manufacturer’s official web page or <a href="https://www.192-168-1-1-ip.co/default-usernames-passwords/">check this page</a> for most common usernames and passwords for various router brands.</p>
<p>If you have done everything properly, you will get access to the router settings page where you can modify various settings like changing the default IP address, username and password, enable and secure your wireless internet connection, and so on.</p>

<h2 class="text-main-header">IP 192.168.0.1.1</h2>
<p>All modern networking devices use IP address 192.168.0.1.1 from factory. Once you logged in the router admin panel of the router, the user can access the features of the router. The router can be adjusted such as LAN, WAN, IP Qos, DNS, Proxy, ADSL, WLAN settings, security options, MAC, DSL, WPS etc. from the router console, user can block the devices and connection can be controlled.</p>

<h2 class="text-main-header">How to login to the address of 192.168.0.1.1?</h2>
<p>On the browser address bar, type the correct IP address <a href="https://www.192-168-1-1-ip.co/192-168-0-1-wireless-router-admin-login/">192.168.0.1</a> on the browser URL and press on the enter button. Type the username and password when the login page comes of the router. Now the user can access the control panel for wireless router operation.</p>
<h2 class="text-main-header">What if I forget my username and password?</h2>
<p>If you forget the custom password, you can’t login with IP 192.168.1.1.1 and need to reset the router or ADSL modem to set the password again. The default login password is found from the manual and back side of the device. If you want to login the router and you cannot retrieve the login details, you need to reset the router. Press the reset button for<strong> 15 seconds</strong> of the router. All settings of the router will be default.</p>

<p>Due to the reset the device, the internet connection will not work for a while. If you do not know how to reset of your device, you should check the router manual.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 class="text-main-header">What is the advantage of using 192.168.10.1?</h2>
<p>192.168.10.1 is a private IP Address that is used by various router manufacturers as the default IP Address. This allows the user to access the device through the web browser on the computer to which the device is connected. It serves for the management of the wireless <strong>router administration  panel</strong>.</p>
<p>It is mostly used by computers for private, home or secure networks. At the time of installment of broadband routers, this IP configuration is installed manually. If someone is unable to access this IP address, it is probably that there is some kind of network issues in configuration. It is a private configuration based on <strong>class C type</strong> which means it is hidden for private networks which are not part of the Internet instead of even being connected to the Internet.</p>
<p>Rather in this case, a router or a modem acts like a passage to carry network data to appropriate computer destination on the secured network. This allows several computers to share a single domain, leaving a snag that home computers do not directly reach the Internet.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Most modems can be even configured to make few computers visible to the Internet on a private network. This IP configuration is web based interface which is generated by network router itself rather than served by web server on Internet which means that all the problems which one is experiencing, there is a good chance that one will be able to find the default admin Username and Password here and fix them without demanding help from outer source.</p>
<p>192.168.10.1 is so popular since only a few configurations are set aside for private networking. Although most Routers chose their configuration as 192.168.1.x leaving most people with a thought that the range starts in the same way. However, the range starts with 192.168.0.0. With range logically starting from <a href="https://www.192-168-1-1-ip.co/">192.168.1.1</a> as thought by leading router manufacturers to start with a whole number, 192.168.10.1 became a lot popular. But this does not suggest that the network client gains a proper network connection or improved security with configurations above this IP address.</p>
<p>Also there are some issues that one faces with this IP configuration. IP address is assigned through Dynamic Host Configuration protocol. It is also to assign this address manually but doing so may result in connection issues in case the router is not duly configured, the internet is not configured accordingly.</p>
<p></p>
<h2 class="text-main-header">How to get the 192.168.10.1 IP?</h2>
<p>Especially each router which is configured through DHCP can allocate its clients. The home router having DHCP as its configurations configured with IP address ranged between <a href="https://www.192-168-1-1-ip.co/">192.168.1.1</a> to <a href="https://www.192-168-1-1-ip.co/192-168-1-254-wireless-router-admin-login/">192.168.1.254</a>. A router does not check before assigning to the client automatically whether it is already assigned to client manually. There is an issue of IP conflict when two computers registered over the same network uses same IP configuration resulting in interference of network communications for both computers.</p>
<h2 class="text-main-header">What is possible to do if you don`t know or forgot the password?</h2>
<p>ou need to reset your gadget to resolve such problem. Simply hold the reset button for several <strong>5 seconds</strong>. But better not to touch the modem if you are not sure you can do everything properly.</p>
